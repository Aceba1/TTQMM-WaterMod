Use the the Setup program in the Installer folder, or copy the Installer folder's contents to your game's install path (for Steam users, it is somthing like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TerraTech Beta`),  go to `TerraTech*_Data\Managed` and run the Manager executable. Whenever the game updates, just run that executable again.
